Jekyll commands:

- `jekyll serve --livereload` for local version 
	- vs `bundle exec jekyll serve`? 
	- Note that _config.yml changes are loaded at compile time, not runtime. This means that if you’re running jekyll serve locally and you edit _config.yml, then changes to it won’t be detected. You’ll need to kill and rerun jekyll serve.
- pushing changes will automatically update live website (takes a few seconds)
- `jekyll build` ? 
	jekyll build will wipe everything in /_sites/. The first step of jekyll build is to delete everything in /_sites/ and then build it all again from scratch. So, you can’t store any files in there and expect them to stick around. Everything that goes into /_sites/ should be generated by Jekyll_

Git commands:
- `git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here`
- `git pull origin branchname --allow-unrelated-histories`
