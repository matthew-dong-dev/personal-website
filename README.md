## To do (Tier 1):

1. link moon template to your github pages page & delete old repo
1. customize about page, home image, background, etc...
1. link to google domain: https://medium.com/@Tnylnc/tnylnc-how-to-set-up-github-pages-with-google-domains-83bd5a4fbc5c 
1. 

### To do (Tier 2): 

1. drop a donation
1. have post home button redirect to actual home
1. Try creating an _include file that inserts Google Analytics tracking code into your <head> so you can get stats on the visitors to your website. Here's an example.
1. Configuring Travis CI on your repo is a great way to track failing builds as well - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24851824/how-long-does-it-take-for-github-page-to-show-changes-after-changing-index-html
1. regex for all png and jpg files?  `\.(png|jpg)`


## Completed: 

1. [x] change theme

useful commands:

- `jekyll serve --livereload` for local version 
	- vs `bundle exec jekyll serve`? 
	- Note that _config.yml changes are loaded at compile time, not runtime. This means that if you’re running jekyll serve locally and you edit _config.yml, then changes to it won’t be detected. You’ll need to kill and rerun jekyll serve.
- pushing changes will automatically update live website (takes a few seconds)
- `jekyll build` ? 
	jekyll build will wipe everything in /_sites/. The first step of jekyll build is to delete everything in /_sites/ and then build it all again from scratch. So, you can’t store any files in there and expect them to stick around. Everything that goes into /_sites/ should be generated by Jekyll


Useful git commands:
- `git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here`
- `git pull origin branchname --allow-unrelated-histories`
