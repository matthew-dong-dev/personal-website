## Local development

Option 1: Install docker and run with `docker build -t personal-website:1.0.0 .` and `docker run -p 4000:4000 personal-website:1.0.0`

Option 2 (better for local dev): Install ruby with rbenv and install bundler (see versions in Dockerfile).  Launch app with `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml` 

Notes: 

- when updating dependencies, may need to delete gemfile.lock before rerunning `bundle install`
- Sometimes you need to clear the browser cache for changes to propogate.  If you change the config file, you need to rebuild the site.  
- If you want to take down pages, just add [maintenance] in front of the md or pdf file, then Jekyll won't be able to find them and will default to the 404 page.  Or set recruiter to false in `config.yml`
- Rm socials by commenting out `include social-links.html` in `header.html` - commenting them in config.yml leaves a random github icon for some reason

## Build & Deployment

App is deployed via a github workflow (see .github/workflows/jekyll.yml)


1. Write tests to be run on build
	- e.g. automate basic regression test - make sure all links work

### Useful commands & resources 

Jekyll:
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` for local version 
	- vs `jekyll serve --livereload`? 
	- Note that _config.yml changes are loaded at compile time, not runtime. This means that if you’re running jekyll serve locally and you edit _config.yml, then changes to it won’t be detected. You’ll need to kill and rerun jekyll serve.
- pushing changes will automatically update live website (takes a few seconds)
- `jekyll build` ? 
	"jekyll build will wipe everything in /_sites/. The first step of jekyll build is to delete everything in /_sites/ and then build it all again from scratch. So, you can’t store any files in there and expect them to stick around. Everything that goes into /_sites/ should be generated by Jekyll_"
