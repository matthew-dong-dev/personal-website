Three words to describe _Calvin and Hobbes_ are timeless, magical, and transcendent. Bill Watterson’s comic strip engaged readers at every age, from every background, and captivated an audience for more than two decades after its final print. First read it when you’re young for the relatability and the slapstick comedy, then read it again when you’re older for the subtleties and sophisticated humor, and discover at each level hidden depths you never realized existed in between the margins. The emotions and ideas Watterson explored in _Calvin and Hobbes_ expand to much larger than the panels they’re packed into, and there’s something about this comic strip that makes it memorable for each individual person.

At its core, the idea behind _Calvin and Hobbes_ is beautifully simple. It follows the escapades of a six year old boy (Calvin) and his stuffed tiger (Hobbes) in seemingly mundane settings and interactions between his parents, classmates, and schoolteachers, which are transformed by his imagination. Calvin is a child who loves cartoons and comic books and struggles with his homework, yet his uncanny insights and advanced vocabulary belie a maturity and philosophy beyond his years. His loyal sidekick Hobbes is an anthropomorphic stuffed tiger brought to life by Calvin’s mind, and together they make an unstoppable duo ready to combat any babysitter or book report to come their way.

So what makes this comic strip so valuable, drawing legions of fans long after its final print and distinguishing it from any other Sunday read?

1. **Substance** - Although _Calvin and Hobbes_ has its fair share of one liners, this comic strip is far more than just a 3 panel buildup to a punchline; it manages to tell entire stories and develop character personalities to a depth found in novels.  As opposed to being a poorly masked political commentary or social critique, _Calvin and Hobbes_ manages to touch on complex subjects such as consumerism, existentialism, and environmentalism in ways that transcended the era it was written in, as Watterson invited readers to explore these ideas on their own through the brash, unbiased innocence of Calvin, tempered by the wisdom of Hobbes.

1. **Watterson’s storytelling ability** - It’s what the author does with the ordinary that makes this comic strip indispensable. Calvin’s vivid imagination, fueled by his Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs, transforms any situation into an adventure, demonstrated by his alter egos of Spaceman Spiff, Stupendous Man, and others, weaved into his daily routines. For Calvin, every bathtime is another impromptu story, every cardboard box a novel invention, and every sled ride has the potential for a philosophical mindtrip. These side arcs generated from mundane situations are brought to life in a way few authors can narrate and few artists can illustrate, but Watterson delivers both seamlessly in this comic strip.

1. **Ubiquity** - The worlds created in _Calvin and Hobbes_ encapsulate all the quirks, creativity, and wonder of childhood, something we’ve all shared, evoking a blend of nostalgia and enthusiasm from the reader. Besides being purely fun to read, _Calvin and Hobbes_ provides a juxtaposition between the “grown up world” and Calvin’s perspectives that serves as a humbling reminder for what’s lost in the transition to adulthood, and what can be regained by embracing a similar mindset.

Perhaps most impressive is that Bill Watterson delivers all these ideas, insights, and perspectives through a comic strip. He elevates this medium with profound philosophies and artistic dexterity, negating any distinction between “high art” versus “low art”, interweaving the thread that united his audience. _Calvin and Hobbes_ is a comic strip that’s truly dynamic: its substance made it timeless, Watterson’s storytelling made it magical, and its themes made it transcendent - all of the above making _Calvin and Hobbes_ truly irreplaceable.
