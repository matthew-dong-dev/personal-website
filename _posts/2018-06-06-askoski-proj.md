## Background

- Web infrastructure in most schools has remained static in an increasingly technological society; in particular, variety in course enrollment platforms remains lacking in higher education. To provide greater personalized course guidance to individual students, _AskOski_ is a state-of-the-art recommender system that lifts machine learning methodologies from other domains to the education field to help improve learning outcomes.  Through historic enrollment data, _AskOski_ suggests courses to users based on similar sequences past students have taken. [Brochure]({{site.url}}/assets/files/askoski_brochure.pdf). 
- The current system is available to the entire undergraduate population at UC Berkeley, with active collaboration to expand to Laney College and UC Irvine.  

### My Involvement 

- My role includes incorporating an "intelligent search" function in addition to the main features of the site to enhance content discovery and the browsing experience. **Check out a beta version [here](https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1380/search).**
- What makes this search “intelligent” is that a query will not only be matched against course titles and descriptions, but also to an additional search metric known as “inferred keywords.” Inferred keywords are a generalized description produced through machine learning that captures a semantic portrayal of courses beyond university catalog descriptions. More details [here]({{site.url}}/assets/files/research-poster-final.pdf).
