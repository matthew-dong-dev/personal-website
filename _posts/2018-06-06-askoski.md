## Background

- Web infrastructures in schools have remained static in an increasingly technological society - in particular, course enrollment platforms remain a Web 1.0 experience for many higher education institutions. In order to provide a more streamlined user experience and greater personalized course guidance, _AskOski_ is a state-of-the-art course recommender system that lifts machine learning methodologies from other domains throughout its features.  Using historic UC Berkeley enrollment data, _AskOski_ provides class suggestions to each user based on similar student enrollment patterns.

### My Involvement 

- My role includes incorporating an intelligent course catalog into the system to improve its versatility and to augment the course discovery process / browsing experience. **Check out a beta version [here](https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1380/search).**
- What makes this course catalog “intelligent” is that a search query will not only be matched against course titles and descriptions, but also to additional “inferred keywords” for each course.  The inferred keywords are a machine learning model’s prediction as to what a class is about based on its true description and its mathematical representation learned from student behavior, intending to capture a semantic portrayal of courses beyond university catalog descriptions.
