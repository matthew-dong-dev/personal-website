## [Background]({{site.url}}/assets/files/askoski_brochure.pdf) about the system

### My Involvement 

- My role includes incorporating an intelligent course catalog into the system to augment the course discovery process / browsing experience. **Check it out [here](https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1380/search).**
- Tools used
- What makes this course catalog “intelligent” is that a search query will not only be matched against course titles and descriptions, but also to additional “inferred keywords” for each course.  The inferred keywords are a machine learning model’s prediction as to what a class is about based on its true description and its mathematical representation learned from student behavior, intending to capture a semantic portrayal of courses beyond university catalog descriptions.
