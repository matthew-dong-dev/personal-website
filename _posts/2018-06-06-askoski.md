### Search Feature

- I incorporated the enhanced course search feature into the site to augment the course discovery process / browsing experience. **Check it out [here](https://askoski.berkeley.edu/search).**
- What differentiates this search feature is that a query will not only be matched against default catalog information, but also to additional inferred topics for each course.  These inferred keywords are produced by machine learning models tagging course embeddings with semantics, i.e. generalizing a class' description based on the descriptions from similar classes.

<!-- - What makes this course catalog “intelligent” is that a search query will not only be matched against course titles and descriptions, but also to additional “inferred keywords” for each course.  The inferred keywords are a machine learning model’s prediction as to what a class is about based on its true description and its mathematical representation learned from student behavior, intending to capture a semantic portrayal of courses beyond university catalog descriptions.  -->
<!-- These predicted keywords are a generalized description that contains words pulled from other course descriptions by way of a classification model mapping from a behaviorally informed course embedding space to a literal course description semantic space.   -->
