## [Background]({{site.url}}/assets/files/askoski_brochure.pdf) about the system

### My Involvement 

- In addition to general system testing and development, I incorporated an enhanced course search into the site to augment the course discovery process / browsing experience. **Check it out [here](https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1380/search).**
- What differentiates this search feature is that a search query will not only be matched against the given course information, but also to additional “inferred keywords” for each course.  These inferred keywords are a generalized description that contains words pulled from other course descriptions by way of a classification model mapping from a behaviorally informed course embedding space to a literal course description semantic space.

<!-- - What makes this course catalog “intelligent” is that a search query will not only be matched against course titles and descriptions, but also to additional “inferred keywords” for each course.  The inferred keywords are a machine learning model’s prediction as to what a class is about based on its true description and its mathematical representation learned from student behavior, intending to capture a semantic portrayal of courses beyond university catalog descriptions.  -->
