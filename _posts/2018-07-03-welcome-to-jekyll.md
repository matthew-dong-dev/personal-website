Hello, and welcome to __Fall 2016 By The Numbers__!

_Background: I began logging data on my life beginning in secondary school, where I was a poor student with many issues with productivity & procrastination.  I started by collecting data on study habits and sleeping patterns and have since expanded to monetary expenditures, calories counting, etc..._ 

The simple act of measuring has helped me maintain accountability, but this is my first attempt to actually look back and analyze my life's data in depth and potentially uncover interesting patterns unknown to even myself. 

> "You can't control what you can't measure." - Me (but not really)

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
