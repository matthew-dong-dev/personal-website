To fix my professional procrastination abilities and inefficient time management, I started tracking my study and sleep habits midway through secondary school to determine where all my time was going.  Soon it became a habit and five years later, I still chronicle my life data daily and have evolved this productivity blog every semester since into a full on personal case study that includes expenditures, calories, happiness, stress, and more. These are my attempts to make sense of that data.

<!-- Long version:  
When I first looked back at the spreadsheet, the rows of numbers were rather unilluminating, so I had to teach myself to transform the data to tell a more compelling story.  I began creating basic visualizations to help identify simple patterns and trends, and continued with more rigorous analyses to answer more nuanced questions about my life.  I enjoyed “building” this project because to me, condensing a messy block of data into an actionable insight is similar to a sculptor creating art out of marble.  It’s as much of an art as a science and by using a wide variety of tools, you can reveal something completely hidden to an audience, or even to yourself.  
From this personal productivity and biometric log, I discovered that studying more doesn’t always translate to better grades, and my stress and happiness levels fluctuated less as I’ve learned to better control my reactions, among others.  But moreover, I learned firsthand the power of “you can’t control what you can’t measure”, as tracking all this data helped me gain control over my life (e.g. when thought I was being productive but was really browsing memes).  I plan on continuing this endeavor into the foreseeable future, and armed with more data and more knowledge, hope to uncover more interesting results in the future.
