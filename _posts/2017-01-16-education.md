### Here are 5 reasons why education reform matters and why it's the path I'm interested in pursuing: 

1. It's time to start playing the infinite game.

	- An infinite game is essentially a game played to keep the game going.  One perspective on our place in time is that we're "born too late to explore the world, and born too early to explore the universe."  However, the era we live in has seen increased lifespans, some of the greatest advancements in science, as well as overall stability, and it's on us to bridge the gap and keep the game going. However, the game is being threatened as we speak with global warming, nuclear arms proliferation, and a willing ignorance of the facts. We’ve come a long way as a human species, but have only begun to scrape the surface of our potential.  Thus, the task is education, and the goal is sustainability.  

1. "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." - Nelson Mandela

	- From poverty to overpopulation, crises in the world grow in scale and urgency every year - the scope of these issues being too broad for any one person to solve. Education is a cornerstone of human development through which an individual gains awareness of the world, fostering a desire to enlighten themselves and others.  As Mother Teresa observed, "I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples."

1. "Every kid starts out as a natural-born scientist, and then we beat it out of them.  Few trickle through the system with their wonder and enthusiasm for science intact.” - Carl Sagan

	- Our current education system relies too much upon performance-based accountability versus creating an environment that fosters curiosity and intellectual growth.  Instead of rewarding intrinsic learning and creativity, it rewards rote memorization and an ability to regurgitate information in a timed setting.  Transforming educational paradigms is easier said than done, but our current system stagnates and even discourages the progress and development of its students, which is a major handicap that needs to be addressed if we are to continue to progress as a society & civilization.

1. Education is the cure for ignorance.

	- The more perspectives people have, the less prejudiced they can be.  We need to stop finding refuge in ignorance, which is only bliss until the consequences come knocking on the door (e.g. environmental degradation.)  Education is the ticket out of poverty and disadvantaged circumstances and furthermore, you find that you're allowed to connect and your struggles are ubiquitous.  As author Scott Fitzgerald puts it, “You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.” 

1. Higher education shouldn’t be a privilege, it should be a right.

	- In this digital age and amidst the technological revolution, automation is happening at a rapid pace in nearly every industry, and "unskilled jobs" are quickly being siphoned out.  However, rather than seeing this as a negative consequence, it should be viewed as a liberating opportunity - as individuals are freed to advance themselves and pursue higher level ideas and careers. However, the majority are locked out of this opportunity due to unaffordable tuition costs, for-profit colleges, etc...More needs to be done to bridge the gap between our advancing technology and the small pool of individuals who can utilize it.  While online educational resources such as MOOCs are a step in the direction, not properly educating your nation’s population in formal school settings is like tying your own shoelaces together - you can barely walk, let alone run.
