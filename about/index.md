<center>  Iâ€™m a student who enjoys creating, traveling, and exploring.  I believe in balance & simplicity, prefer to be outdoors, and would like to own a Bernese Mountain Dog.  In terms of the future, I'm interested in the intersection of education reform, data science, and sustainability.  </center>
