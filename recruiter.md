Experience 
----------

<p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>Target Corporation - Software Engineer II/Senior Engineer</strong></p>
<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;"> <i>Inventory Management Core Data team (Aug 2022 - Feb 2024)</i> </p>


- Helped design and implement rewrite of a large scale legacy application calculating supply chain data attributes for millions of Target items to improve its performance, scalability, and maintainability.  Utilized an event driven microservice architecture as well as converted from a REST API to GraphQL for downstream consumers.
- Fulfilled on call responsibilities/production support - fixed bugs and educated users, triaged and resolved several high priority incidents causing work stoppages at distribution centers.
- Played key role in new team formation by creating both technical and non-technical infrastructure (e.g. build and deploy pipelines, application templates, documentation and working agreements, etc.) and took greater responsibility in product planning and mentoring interns/junior engineers.  

<p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>Target Corporation - Software Engineer II</strong></p>
<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;"> <i>Supply Chain Business Data Authoring team (Nov 2021 - Aug 2022)</i> </p>

- Built new back-end capabilities in a variety of data driven supply chain applications.  All features included publishing to/consuming from Kafka topics, persisting data to databases, auditing, test coverage, and alerting/metrics.  Collaborated with product owners to write stories and outline acceptance criteria, implemented design, managed releases on private cloud platform, and followed through with performance monitoring.
    - Examples include implementing business logic describing whether items are eligible for certain automation/fulfillment processes, building API allowing managers to set which stores can receive certain inventory pushes, and data ingestion app used to transform and publish data for trailer loading optimization.
- In both legacy and modern applications - addressed tech debt (API migrations, major dependency updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.) and improved codebases (automated CI/CD steps, SSL cert renewals, secrets management, contributed to libraries, improved logs and observability, rewrote code, etc.)
