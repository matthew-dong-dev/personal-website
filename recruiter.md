Experience 
----------

**Software Engineer (Back-End) - Target Corporation**

- Built several new API features across the stores & supply chain space including: push block (enables managers to set which stores can receive inventory pushes), bulky attribute (new item attribute determining whether an item is eligible for automation processes at distribution centers), truckload optimization (CRUD application for transforming and publishing data used to optimize trailer loading).  
    - All features included persisting data to postgres and Kafka, necessary alerting & metrics, as well as auditing and test coverage (unit, functional, integration).  
    - Collaborated with product owners, outlined acceptance criteria, executed design, implemented code feedback. 
- In both legacy and modern applications - addressed tech debt (handled several API migrations, major dependency updates, and resolved security vulnerabilities) and implemented best software practices (updated CI / CD pipelines, contributed core library updates, improved auditing, rewrote code as necessary).
- Handled on call responsibilities - resolved bugs and educated users, triaged several incidents generating work stoppages.
