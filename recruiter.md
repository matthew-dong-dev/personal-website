<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;"> <i>Inventory Management Core Data team (Aug 2022 - Feb 2024)</i> </p>


- Helped design and implement rewrite of large scale legacy application calculating supply chain data attributes for millions of Target items to reflect real time updates, improve performance, scalability, and maintainability, as well as convert the API from REST to GraphQL for downstream consumers.
- Played key role in new team formation by creating both technical and non-technical infrastructure (e.g. new application templates, build and deployment pipelines, onboarding documentation, team working agreements, etc.) and taking greater responsibility in product planning and mentoring interns/junior engineers.  
- Fulfilled on call responsibilities/production support - fixed bugs and educated users, triaged and resolved several high priority incidents causing work stoppages at distribution centers.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>Target Corporation - Software Engineer</strong></p>
<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;"> <i>Supply Chain Business Data Authoring team (Nov 2021 - Aug 2022)</i> </p>

- Built new back-end capabilities in a variety of stores & supply chain apps e.g. attributes describing whether items are eligible for certain automation/fulfillment processes at distribution centers and stores, feature allowing managers to set which stores can receive inventory pushes, and data pipelines used to transform and publish data for trailer loading optimization.
    - All features included publishing to/consuming from Kafka topics, persisting data to databases, auditing, test coverage, and alerting/metrics. 
    - Collaborated with product owners, outlined acceptance criteria, implemented design, managed releases, and followed through with performance monitoring.
- In both legacy and modern applications - addressed tech debt (API migrations, major dependency updates, security vulnerabilities, etc.) and improved codebases (automated CI/CD steps, SSL cert renewals, secrets management, contributed to libraries, improved logs and observability, rewrote code, created documentation, etc.)
